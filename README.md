# Assessing Global Development Needs: A Data Driven Approach for Strategic Aid Allocation
This project leverages unsupervised machine learning techniques to categorize countries based on critical socio-economic and health factors such as child mortality, exports, health, imports, income, inflation, life expectancy, total fertility rate, and GDP per capita that influence their overall development. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to identify patterns and group countries into categories reflecting their need for assistance. The findings will enable HELP International to strategically allocate $10 million in aid to the countries that require it the most, optimizing resource distribution and maximizing impact in alleviating poverty and improving living conditions.
